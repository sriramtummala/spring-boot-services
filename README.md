# spring-boot-services
This is a sample project which demonstrates how to create hands on Restful apis using spring boot
I mainly concentrated on on the following topics

# Basic hello world example with custom exception handling and message properties
look at package com.restful.webservices.restfulwebservices.helloworld

# Using JPA and h2, create a service that connects to database and perform operations like create, get, delete
look at package com.restful.webservices.restfulwebservices.user

# Versioning
you can create multiple versions of the api through different ways.
look at package com.restful.webservices.restfulwebservices.versioning

# filtering
you can filter fields that you want to expose to your consumer
look atpackage com.restful.webservices.restfulwebservices.filtering
